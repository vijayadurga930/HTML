SGML is based on the idea that documents have structural and other semantic elements that
 can be described without reference to how such elements should be displayed.
 HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts. It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. 
 This set is sometimes called HTML5 & friends and often shortened to just HTML5.
